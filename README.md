# Learning NumPy

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and practice files created while learning the **NumPy** library.  
The notebooks are divided into four phases, each focusing on different features and use cases of NumPy.

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Phases

### ðŸ“– Phase 1 â€” NumPy Arrays and Fundamentals (`phase-1.ipynb`)
Covers the basic building blocks of NumPy.

- **Array Creation**: Creating 1D and 2D arrays.  
- **Performance Comparison**: NumPy arrays vs Python lists.  
- **Array Initialization**: Using `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.random()`, and `np.arange()`.  
- **Properties**: Exploring `shape`, `size`, `ndim`, and `dtype`.  
- **Array Reshaping**: Using `reshape()`, `flatten()`, `ravel()`, and `.T` (transpose).

### ðŸ“– Phase 2 â€” Indexing, Slicing, and Sorting (`phase-2.ipynb`)
Focuses on accessing and manipulating array data.

- **Indexing and Slicing**: Basic and advanced slicing in 1D and 2D arrays.  
- **Sorting**: Sorting arrays with `np.sort()`.  
- **Filtering**: Boolean masking to filter arrays.  
- **Conditional Selection**: Using `np.where()` and fancy indexing.  
- **Adding & Removing Elements**: Combining arrays with `np.concatenate()` and removing with `np.delete()`.  
- **Array Stacking**: Joining arrays using `np.vstack()` and `np.hstack()`.

### ðŸ“– Phase 3 â€” Practice with Business Data (`phase-3.ipynb`)
Applies NumPy operations to a simple dataset (restaurant sales).

- **Data Analysis**: Finding totals, min, max, and averages by year and restaurant.  
- **Vector Operations**: Addition, multiplication, and dot products.  
- **Vectorization**: Using `np.vectorize()` to apply a function to all elements of an array.

### ðŸ“– Phase 4 â€” Broadcasting and File Handling (`phase-4.ipynb`)
Covers two important concepts for efficiency and data storage.

- **Broadcasting**: Performing operations on arrays of different shapes.  
- **File I/O**: Saving arrays as `.npy` files and loading them back.
